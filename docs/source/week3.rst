[Week 3] Intro to Encapsulation
===============================

Summary
-------

Now that we've started to practice mastering the state of objects 
(keeping track of their properties), we will work on making our code more efficient.

**Important Concepts**

1. Encapsulation.  
    - The packaging of code to be reused later
    - Example: if we have multiple objects, and we want to make them bounce off walls, 
               then we could either write the wall bouncing code for each object, or write the code
               once and use a function to apply it to each object.

[Week 1] Hello PyGame
=====================

Welcome to the first week of Object Oriented Programming with Python and Pygame!


Summary
-------

We went over the basics of Python to see what parts of Python would need to be practiced.

After the assessment, we started playing with PyGame, beginning with a tour
of the game loop.  We spent the rest of the classing playing with the basic
objects of Pygame.

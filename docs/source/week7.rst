3. Designing an ecosystem of objects in the game
    - :doc:`Click here for the exercise page <exercises/object_ecosystem>`

In designing the game, you should identify:

1. an entity that will be used in many places
    - examples include bricks in brickbreak games
    - monsters in other games
    - projectiles
    - etc
2. identify the basic functionality
3. plan out the flow of the game
    - what will the hero do
    - what will trigger what
    - what will be the goal
    - what will be the inputs

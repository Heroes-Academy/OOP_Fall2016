[Week 7] Object Ecosystems
==========================

Last week we talked about designing objects.
This week, we will be talking about how you can make an ecosystem of objects to work together.

First, we will talk more specifically about inheritance.
- I will create a set of exercises for anyone to go through who feels that they are having trouble with objects.
- this set of exercises will break out of the pygame theme
- instead, it will start with the simple object and have them use that to understand.

The ecosystem is going to look at first what it means to inherit from sprite.
a sprite has a very specific set of functions.

Also, draw a diagram of how all of these things fit together.
Also also, expand the cheat sheet for pygame stuff. it should include classes and pygame functions.

include the following:
- importing
- basic classes
- inheritance
- instantiation
- functional programming

given a sprite-based hero, start planning out the rest of the game.

the planning should identify:
1. an entity that will be used in many places
    - examples include bricks in brickbreak games
    - monsters in other games
    - projectiles
    - etc
2. identify the basic functionality
3. plan out the flow of the game
    - what will the hero do
    - what will trigger what
    - what will be the goal
    - what will be the inputs

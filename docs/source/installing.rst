Installing Python
=================

Python Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several ways to get Python. My recommended way is the `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ distribution. It includes both Python and a bunch of other things packaged with it that make it super useful.

Instructions for downloading Anaconda Python:

 - Click the link above.
 - If you use a Mac, look at the section titled "Anaconda for OS X," and click on "MAC OS X 64-BIT GRAPHICAL INSTALLER" under the "Python 3.5" section.
 - If you use a Windows computer, in the section titled "Anaconda for Windows," click either "WINDOWS 64-BIT GRAPHICAL INSTALLER" or "WINDOWS 32-BIT GRAPHICAL INSTALLER"  under the "Python 3.5" section.
  - On most Windows machines, you can tell if it's a 64-bit or 32-bit system by right-clicking on the Windows logo and selecting "System." The line labeled "System Type" should say either 64-bit or 32-bit. If you're having trouble with this, simply email me and I'll help you out!
 - Once you click the button, an installer file will be downloaded to your computer. When it finishes downloading, run the installer file.
 - Follow along with the prompts, and select "Register Anaconda as my default Python 3.5" if you're using the Windows installer.
 - At the end of the installation wizard, you're done! Anaconda, and Python, are installed.


An Editor
^^^^^^^^^

There are many good editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). As you're just beginning to learn how to use Python, it's a good idea to use a simplistic, lightweight development environment. `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/>`_ and `Sublime Text <https://sublimetext.com/>`_ are both good choices for starting out. They have nice, clean appearances, highlight your code to make it easier to read, and are easy to jump in and start coding right away.

Instructions for downloading PyCharm:

 - Click the link above.
 - Click "Download" under the "Community" section.
 - An installer file will be downloaded to your computer. When it finishes downloading, run the installer file.
 - Follow along with the installer, and select "add .py extension" if you see the option
 - At the end of the installation wizard, you're done! PyCharm is now installed.
 
 
 
Other than those two, GitHub has an editor that is very comparable to Sublime Text.  It is called `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_.
